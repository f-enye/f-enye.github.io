My name is Frank Peña. I'm a Software Engineer based in Austin, Texas. This is frankenye.com where I share my thoughts about anything related to software engineering.

I currently build neat things at [findhelp.org](https://findhelp.org).

I used to do tech for improv shows. To name a few, this includes 
* [BUDDY COP: METRO CITY NIGHTS](https://www.hideouttheatre.com/shows/buddycop/)
* [¡ESCÁNDALO!](https://web.archive.org/web/20180329045506/https://www.hideouttheatre.com/shows/escandalo/)
