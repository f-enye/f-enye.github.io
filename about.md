My name is Frank Peña. I'm a Software Engineer based in Austin, Texas. This is frankenye.com where I share my thoughts about anything related to software engineering.

I currently build neat things with my colleagues at [findhelp](https://findhelp.org).

I used to do stage tech work for improv shows. Below are links to a few of the shows I've been a part of.
